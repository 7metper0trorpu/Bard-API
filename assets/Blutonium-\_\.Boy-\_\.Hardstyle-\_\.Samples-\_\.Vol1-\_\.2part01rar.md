But who is Blutonium Boy, and how did he become one of the most influential figures in hardstyle music? Blutonium Boy's real name is Dirk Adamiak, and he was born on April 26, 1970 in Baden-Baden, Germany[^2^] [^3^]. He started his DJ career in 1986, playing in a small club in southern Germany. In 1988, he left the club and played in front of 2,500 visitors, which earned him his first booking requests from abroad.
 
In 1997, he founded his own record label, Blutonium Records, where he released his first work as DJ Session One, called Dreams in my Fantasy. The track was marketed worldwide by EastWest (Warner), and received airplay on Viva, a German music channel. This helped him to achieve his breakthrough and establish his name in the scene. Over the years, Blutonium Records grew into the Blutonium Media Germany Group, which has published more than 170 works with several sub-labels and operates a social network for musicians called Blupile.
 
Blutonium Boy has also collaborated with many other artists and labels in the hardstyle genre, such as Showtek, Headhunterz, Zany, Technoboy, Tuneboy, Isaac, and more. He has performed at many festivals and events around the world, such as Defqon.1, Qlimax, Q-Base, Decibel Outdoor, Mysteryland, Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas, and more. He is known for his energetic and powerful style of hardstyle, which often features distorted kicks, screeches, vocals, and melodies.
 
Blutonium Boy is still active and producing hardstyle music today. He has released several albums and singles over the years, such as Hardstyle Dimension (2004), Hardstyle Instructor (2005), Essential of Hardstyle Vol.1 (2007), Hardstyle Instructor is Back (2012), Make it Loud (2013), Drop That Shit (2014), Your Time (2015), Dirty Dropz (2016), Turn Up The Bass (2017), Wild & Wicked (2018), Still Here (2019), and more. He is also continuing his compilation series Hardstyle with Hardstyle Vol. 28 (2023), which features tracks from various hardstyle artists.
